			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Inflation Reduction Act dedicated $27 billion to build a new kind of climate institution in America — a network of national green banks that could lend money to companies, states, schools, churches, and housing developers to build more clean energy and deploy more next-generation energy technology around the country.</p><br><p>It was an innovative and untested program. And the Trump administration is desperately trying to block it. Since February, Trump’s criminal justice appointees — led by Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia — have tried to use criminal law to undo the program. After failing to get the FBI and Justice Department to block the flow of funds, Trump officials have successfully gotten the program’s bank partner to freeze relevant money. The new green banks have sued to gain access to the money.</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with <a href="https://www.aspenideas.org/speakers/kristina-costa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kristina Costa</a>, who has been tracking the effort to bankrupt the green banks. Costa helped lead the Inflation Reduction Act’s implementation in the White House from 2022 to 2025 — and is a previous Shift Key guest. She joins us to discuss how Trump is weaponing criminal law to block a climate program, whether there’s any precedent for his actions, and what could come next in the legal battle.

The new green banks have sued to gain access to the money.</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with <a href="https://www.aspenideas.org/speakers/kristina-costa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kristina Costa</a>, who has been tracking the effort to bankrupt the green banks. Costa helped lead the Inflation Reduction Act’s implementation in the White House from 2022 to 2025 — and is a previous Shift Key guest. She joins us to discuss how Trump is weaponing criminal law to block a climate program, whether there’s any precedent for his actions, and what could come next in the legal battle. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.</p><br><p>Mentioned:&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-e7-ggrf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hardest Working $27 Billion in the IRA</a></p><br><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-e17-kristina-costa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How Democrats Are Trying to Trump-Proof Their Big Climate Law</a></p><br><p>Washington Post: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/02/18/federal-prosecutor-dc-resigns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Top-ranking career prosecutor resigns after declining to block FBI program</a></p><br><p>Denise Cheung’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/18/read-resignation-letter-denise-cheung/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resignation letter</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-energy-demand-surged-in-2024-to-almost-twice-its-recent-average" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jesse’s</a> <a href="https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Mar/Record-Breaking-Annual-Growth-in-Renewable-Power-Capacity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upshift</a>; <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/earth/arctic-winter-sea-ice-at-record-low/#:~:text=Winter%20sea%20ice%20cover%20in,the%20University%20of%20Colorado%2C%20Boulder." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rob’s downshift</a>.</p><br><p>--</p><p>Music for Shift Key is by Adam Kromelow.</p><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you care about decarbonizing the power grid anytime soon, you have to care about data centers. The AI boom and the ongoing growth of the internet have driven a big new cycle of data center construction in the United States, with tech companies trying to buy amounts of electricity comparable to those used by large cities.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Peter Freed has seen this up close.

What are the real-world constraints on developing a data center in 2025? Are tech companies beginning to run out of natural gas to burn? What do their investments in clean energy mean?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Republicans in Washington are pushing for at least two big changes to the country’s car-related policies.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The first few weeks of the new Trump administration have seen an onslaught of anti-climate actions: an order punishing the wind industry, an attempted reversal of the Environmental Protection Administration’s climate authority, and a brazen — and possibly unconstitutional — attempt to freeze all spending under Biden’s climate laws. Democrats’ climate legacy seems to be under assault. How will they respond?&nbsp;</p><br><p>Senator Brian Schatz has represented Hawaii in the U.S. Senate since 2010. He is the chief deputy whip for the Democratic Party. A self-described climate hawk, he helped shape what became the Inflation Reduction Act, and he has emerged as an early voice of opposition to the second Trump administration. He was previously Hawaii’s lieutenant governor and a state lawmaker.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk to Schatz about congressional Democrats’ plan to push back against Trump, what the clean energy needs to do for the next four years, and whether this climate backlash to Trump should be different than the last one. Shift Key is hosted by Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University, and Robinson Meyer, Heatmap’s executive editor.</p><br><p>Mentioned:</p><br><p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-funding-freeze-workarounds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Courts Blocked Trump’s Federal Funding Freeze.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>The first few weeks of the new Trump administration have seen an onslaught of anti-climate actions: an order punishing the wind industry, an attempted reversal of the Environmental Protection Administration’s climate authority, and a brazen — and possibly unconstitutional — attempt to freeze all spending under Biden’s climate laws. Democrats’ climate legacy seems to be under assault. How will they respond?&nbsp;</p><br><p>Senator Brian Schatz has represented Hawaii in the U.S. Senate since 2010. He is the chief deputy whip for the Democratic Party. A self-described climate hawk, he helped shape what became the Inflation Reduction Act, and he has emerged as an early voice of opposition to the second Trump administration. He was previously Hawaii’s lieutenant governor and a state lawmaker.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk to Schatz about congressional Democrats’ plan to push back against Trump, what the clean energy needs to do for the next four years, and whether this climate backlash to Trump should be different than the last one. Shift Key is hosted by Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University, and Robinson Meyer, Heatmap’s executive editor.</p><br><p>Mentioned:</p><br><p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-funding-freeze-workarounds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Courts Blocked Trump’s Federal Funding Freeze.

More than that, the U.S. oil industry has come to depend on Canada’s thick, sulfurous oil to blend with America’s light, sweet domestic product to suit its highly specialized refineries.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The rise of artificial intelligence and the associated expansion of data centers is driving surging demand for new power supply. Earlier this fall at the&nbsp;annual meeting&nbsp;of Princeton University’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, Jesse sat down with a panel of experts to&nbsp;discuss how society can meet the growing energy demands of AI while staying on track broader decarbonization efforts. </p><br><p>How will we power the growing demand from AI and data centers?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You don’t need us to say it: The 2024 election will have enormous stakes for America’s climate policy and the planet’s climate. But how well can we quantify those stakes? What would a Trump presidency — or a Harris presidency, for that matter — really mean for the country’s emissions trajectory?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob speak with <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/team-member/sonia-aggarwal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sonia Aggarwal</a>, the chief executive officer of Energy Innovation, a climate policy think tank that operates across North America, Europe, and Asia.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>You don’t need us to say it: The 2024 election will have enormous stakes for America’s climate policy and the planet’s climate. But how well can we quantify those stakes? What would a Trump presidency — or a Harris presidency, for that matter — really mean for the country’s emissions trajectory?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob speak with <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/team-member/sonia-aggarwal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sonia Aggarwal</a>, the chief executive officer of Energy Innovation, a climate policy think tank that operates across North America, Europe, and Asia.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago this week, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in clean energy and climate mitigation in American history. It contained roughly two dozen new or expanded tax credits that will — if the forecasts bear out — provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding over the next decade. The administration is now rushing to finalize those provisions before the November election.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Perhaps no official has been more central to setting up those tax credits than <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/Wally-Adeyemo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wally Adeyemo</a>, the deputy secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago this week, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in clean energy and climate mitigation in American history. It contained roughly two dozen new or expanded tax credits that will — if the forecasts bear out — provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding over the next decade. The administration is now rushing to finalize those provisions before the November election.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Perhaps no official has been more central to setting up those tax credits than <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/Wally-Adeyemo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wally Adeyemo</a>, the deputy secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department. He is also the Treasury’s No. 2 official and chief operating officer. Adeyemo has led the agency’s effort to implement the climate law, overseeing a group of tax lawyers and political appointees who are critical to the legislation’s ultimate success. He joins Shift Key this week to help us kick off our second season and talk about how the effort to implement the climate law is going, what could stand in its way, and why he wants some kind of permitting reform.</p><br><p>Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.</p><br><p>Mentioned:&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-tax-credit-data" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The First IRA Tax Credit Data Is In</a></p><br><p>Senator Manchin and Senator Barrasso’s <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/manchin-barrasso-release-bipartisan-energy-permitting-reform-legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permitting reform proposal</a></p><br><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-bill-energy-wonks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Why Energy Wonks Love the Permitting Deal</a></p><br><p><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Energy-IRA-Brief_R04-9.26.22.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Inflation Reduction Act: A Summary</a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-chinas-co2-falls-1-in-q2-2024-in-first-quarterly-drop-since-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jesse’s upshift</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afb729b9-9641-42b2-97ca-93974c461c4c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rob’s shift</a>.</p><br><p>--</p><p>This episode of Shift Key is sponsored by …</p><br><p><strong>Watershed</strong>’s climate data engine helps companies measure and reduce their emissions, turning the data they already have into an audit-ready carbon footprint backed by the latest climate science.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Jesse is on vacation until August, so this is a special, Rob-only summer episode of Shift Key.</em></p><br><p>Over the past few weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court has profoundly changed how the federal government does its day-to-day work. In a series of landmark rulings, the high court sharply curtailed the ability of government agencies — including the Environmental Protection Agency — to write and enforce rules and regulations.</p><br><p>That will change how the federal government oversees the products we buy, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. But it could also alter how the government regulates heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution.</p><br><p>But how, exactly, will these new rulings affect climate law? And is there an upside to the deregulatory revolution? This week, Rob holds a roundtable with two environmental law experts about what the high court’s rulings mean for America’s decarbonization project — and whether the court just inadvertently made the country’s already burdensome permitting process even worse. They are Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former Obama administration lawyer, and Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor.</p><br><p>This episode of Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap.</p><br><p>Mentioned:&nbsp;</p><br><p>This year’s four big decisions: <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-451" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Loper Bright</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-1008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Corner Post</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-859" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Jarkesy</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/23A349" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Ohio v.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p><em>Jesse is on vacation until August, so this is a special, Rob-only summer episode of Shift Key.</em></p><br><p>Over the past few weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court has profoundly changed how the federal government does its day-to-day work. In a series of landmark rulings, the high court sharply curtailed the ability of government agencies — including the Environmental Protection Agency — to write and enforce rules and regulations.</p><br><p>That will change how the federal government oversees the products we buy, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. But it could also alter how the government regulates heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution.</p><br><p>But how, exactly, will these new rulings affect climate law? And is there an upside to the deregulatory revolution? This week, Rob holds a roundtable with two environmental law experts about what the high court’s rulings mean for America’s decarbonization project — and whether the court just inadvertently made the country’s already burdensome permitting process even worse. They are Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former Obama administration lawyer, and Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor.</p><br><p>This episode of Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap.</p><br><p>Mentioned:&nbsp;</p><br><p>This year’s four big decisions: <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-451" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Loper Bright</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-1008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Corner Post</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-859" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Jarkesy</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/23A349" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Ohio v.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>China’s electric vehicle industry has driven itself to the center of the global conversation. Its automakers produce dozens of affordable, technologically advanced electric vehicles that rival — and often beat — anything coming out of Europe or North America.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Rooftop solar is four times more expensive in America than it is in other countries. It’s also good for the climate. Should we even care about its high cost?&nbsp;</p><br><p>Yes, says Severin Borenstein, an economist and the director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.

Similar forces could soon spread the cost-shift problem across the country.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with Borenstein about who pays for rooftop solar, why power bills are going up everywhere, and about whether the government should take over electric utilities.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Can capitalism solve climate change? Wrong question, argues the author and journalist Akshat Rathi: In fact, you can’t solve climate change <em>without</em> capitalism. Look around the world, as Rathi does in his new book <em>Climate Capitalism</em>, and he says you’ll find companies and leaders who are proving that cutting carbon emissions is not just possible, but also profitable.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The venture capitalist Sophie Purdom, the founder of Planeteer Capital, spends her days looking for those profitable climate companies. She says that a newer, smarter generation of climate startups is on the way.</p><br><p>In this week’s episode, recorded earlier this month live at Princeton University, Rob and Jesse host a special in-person conversation with Rathi and Purdom. They talk about the rise of Chinese EVs, what interest rates mean for the energy transition, and the proper role of policy in decarbonizing. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems engineering.</p><br><p>Mentioned:&nbsp;</p><br><p>Akshat Rathi’s <a href="https://akshatrathi.com/book/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Climate Capitalism</em></a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.sightlineclimate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sightline Climate</a></p><br><p>Martin Wolf’s <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-crisis-of-democratic-capitalism-martin-wolf/18495593?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwztOwBhD7ARIsAPDKnkDAtBSNadyxTtyxoJfcQHBEE9PgTGHm87W14gBMeTzeEI3FqGHuFGwaAsr2EALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism</em></a></p><br><p>–</p><p>This episode of Shift Key is sponsored by…</p><br><p><strong>KORE Power</strong> provides the commercial, industrial, and utility markets with functional solutions that advance the clean energy transition worldwide.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Can capitalism solve climate change? Wrong question, argues the author and journalist Akshat Rathi: In fact, you can’t solve climate change <em>without</em> capitalism. Look around the world, as Rathi does in his new book <em>Climate Capitalism</em>, and he says you’ll find companies and leaders who are proving that cutting carbon emissions is not just possible, but also profitable.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The venture capitalist Sophie Purdom, the founder of Planeteer Capital, spends her days looking for those profitable climate companies. She says that a newer, smarter generation of climate startups is on the way.</p><br><p>In this week’s episode, recorded earlier this month live at Princeton University, Rob and Jesse host a special in-person conversation with Rathi and Purdom. They talk about the rise of Chinese EVs, what interest rates mean for the energy transition, and the proper role of policy in decarbonizing. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems engineering.</p><br><p>Mentioned:&nbsp;</p><br><p>Akshat Rathi’s <a href="https://akshatrathi.com/book/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Climate Capitalism</em></a></p><br><p><a href="https://www.sightlineclimate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sightline Climate</a></p><br><p>Martin Wolf’s <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-crisis-of-democratic-capitalism-martin-wolf/18495593?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwztOwBhD7ARIsAPDKnkDAtBSNadyxTtyxoJfcQHBEE9PgTGHm87W14gBMeTzeEI3FqGHuFGwaAsr2EALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism</em></a></p><br><p>–</p><p>This episode of Shift Key is sponsored by…</p><br><p><strong>KORE Power</strong> provides the commercial, industrial, and utility markets with functional solutions that advance the clean energy transition worldwide.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Radia is a $1 billion climate tech startup with an unusual pitch: It is trying to build the world’s largest airplane. Its proposed aircraft, the Radia Wind Runner, would be as long as a football field, nearly as wide as a New York city block, and capable of carrying 12 times the volume of a Boeing 747.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, the electric-car maker Rivian announced its new SUV, the R2 — a $45,000 family hauler that will get more than 300 miles in range. It also debuted the R3 and R3X hatchbacks, which entranced online car nerds.&nbsp;</p><br><p>These new Rivian models are sleek and important, but they won’t go on sale until 2026 at the earliest. Can Rivian last that long? In this week’s episode, Rob and Jesse discuss Rivian’s quest to survive, how electrification is changing car design, and the coolest EVs coming down the pike.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, the electric-car maker Rivian announced its new SUV, the R2 — a $45,000 family hauler that will get more than 300 miles in range. It also debuted the R3 and R3X hatchbacks, which entranced online car nerds.&nbsp;</p><br><p>These new Rivian models are sleek and important, but they won’t go on sale until 2026 at the earliest. Can Rivian last that long? In this week’s episode, Rob and Jesse discuss Rivian’s quest to survive, how electrification is changing car design, and the coolest EVs coming down the pike. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems engineering.</p><br><p>Mentioned:</p><br><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-suv-r2-r3-r3x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Look Closely at Rivian’s New SUV.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For a few weeks now, Heatmap’s staff writer, Emily Pontecorvo, has been trying to figure out if installing rooftop solar panels on your home actually reduces carbon pollution in a systematic way.

			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>For a few weeks now, Heatmap’s staff writer, Emily Pontecorvo, has been trying to figure out if installing rooftop solar panels on your home actually reduces carbon pollution in a systematic way. In other words: If you own a home, and install solar panels on it, are you doing anything to change how much fossil fuel gets burned in your region or around the world? Or — somewhat counterintuitively — will your panels just increase the cost of electricity near you while shifting demand for those fossil fuels around?&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode, we try to answer these questions in a satisfying way.
